# Wakatime Spoofer by Peretas Technologies

Welcome to the **Wakatime Spoofer**!  
This is a totally legit tool made by **Peretas Technologies** for educational and fun purposes only. üåü  
It‚Äôs designed to help you simulate activity on Wakatime with human-like precision (and a dash of chaos).

## Features

- **Spoofs Wakatime activity** with customizable, human-like typing intervals.
- **Automatically types out scripts** into VS Code to look like you‚Äôre working hard!
- **Simple interface** with an easy-to-use tutorial for new users.
- **Fully compatible with macOS only** (sorry, Windows and Linux users ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è).

## How It Works

1. **Provide a raw script URL** (e.g., from GitHub).
2. **Customize typing speed and intervals** to make it look legit.
3. Sit back and **let the spoofer do the work** while you chill.
4. Join the fun on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/peretas)!

## How to Use

1. Install **Python** (if you haven‚Äôt already).
2. Make sure you‚Äôre on **macOS** (this won‚Äôt work on Windows or Linux).
3. Run the program and follow the prompts:
   - Enter your script‚Äôs **raw URL**.
   - Set typing and **line intervals** (make them human-like, or you‚Äôre sus!).
4. Keep **VS Code** open and focused while the spoofer does its thing.

## Downloading and Installing on macOS

1. Download **Wakatime Spoofer** from the [Releases page](#) on this repo.
2. You'll download the file `wakatimespoofer-macos`.
3. Open your **Terminal** and type:
    ```bash
    cd downloads
    ```
4. Then, type the following commands to grant execute permissions:
    ```bash

    ```
    This allows you to run Wakatime Spoofer.
5. To run **Wakatime Spoofer**, type:
    ```bash
    ./wakatimespoofer-macos
    ```
