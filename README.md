Wakatime Spoofer by Peretas Technologies

Welcome to the Wakatime Spoofer!

This is a totally legit tool made by Peretas Technologies for educational and fun purposes only. üåü
It‚Äôs designed to help you simulate activity on Wakatime with human-like precision (and a dash of chaos).

Features

	‚Ä¢	Spoofs Wakatime activity with customizable, human-like typing intervals.
	‚Ä¢	Automatically types out scripts into VS Code to look like you‚Äôre working hard!
	‚Ä¢	Simple interface with an easy-to-use tutorial for new users.
	‚Ä¢	Fully compatible with macOS only (sorry, Windows and Linux users ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è).

How It Works

	1.	Provide a raw script URL (e.g., from GitHub).
	2.	Customize typing speed and intervals to make it look legit.
	3.	Sit back and let the spoofer do the work while you chill.
	4.	Join the fun on discord.gg/peretas!

How to Use

	1.	Install Python (if you haven‚Äôt already).
	2.	Make sure you‚Äôre on macOS (this won‚Äôt work on Windows or Linux).
	3.	Run the program and follow the prompts:
	‚Ä¢	Enter your script‚Äôs raw URL.
	‚Ä¢	Set typing and line intervals (make them human-like, or you‚Äôre sus!).
	4.	Keep VS Code open and focused while the spoofer does its thing.

Pro Tip: Use realistic intervals, like:
	‚Ä¢	Characters: 0.4s - 1.2s
	‚Ä¢	Lines: 1.5s - 3s
